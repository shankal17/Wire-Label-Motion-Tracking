# Overview

This was a prototype feature for the senior capstone design project that my team worked on at Grove City College. The goal of the project was to create an electromechanical device to apply shrink wrapped labels to wires. To do this, the machine has to locate and track the labels as they move through the machine. This is the first prototype to accomplish this. A camera was mounted to view the feed mechanism from the top down to get the view shown.

## Getting Started

Once you have the code, set up a virtual environment if you would like and install the necessary libraries by running the command below.

```bat
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

## Things To Be Done

- [ ] Integrate with existing control system (PLC)
- [ ] Extract text printed on each label
- [ ] Detect each label size
